Issue Type\r\n\r\nFeature Request / Question\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nMaybe this is already possible, but I didn't spot anything in the docs\r\nwithin a Multi-root Workspace where you have a .code-workspace file like the below with multiple folders listed\r\n\r\nis there a variable for the top level directory where the .code-workspace lives?\r\n${workspaceFolder} equals the path of the folder which changes from folder to folder\r\nin the below example ${workspaceFolder}/../ works fine for most folders, but not the Root one which is one directory up\r\n\r\nHaving a common set of settings for for all folders where there are file paths are involved at different levels makes things difficult if your trying to create a path that's relative to the location of the .code-workspace file\r\n\r\nIf there was a variable that represented the top level directory ./ (Root where the .code-workspace file lives)\r\nthis would make life a bit easier when referencing things like virtual environments within python\r\n\r\nAnother way around this is if there was such a thing as custom variables, since you can reference a setting via\r\n${config:Name} but not create a custom setting for use later on in a path setting.\r\n\r\n## Example .code-workspace file\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"folders\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Library\",\r\n            \"path\":

been using doc comments more and more in our code to automatically generate documentation, which is starting to be really productive. Tools like ESDoc and Typedoc are capable of statically analyzing the code and producing a ton of helpful docs. \r\n\r\nOur generator setup generally compiles the description in doc comments as Markdown, which makes writing examples super easy. Except, VSCode's comment blocks in Javascript interfere with this quite a lot, specifically the leading `*` characters on each line. There are two main ways it is problematic:\r\n\r\n1. Copy pasting a snippet into a doc block comment does _not_ add leading `*`, which results in having to add an asterisk to each line. This can be very painful with large examples:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  /**\r\n   * this is an example function, here's how you use it\r\n   * \r\n   * ```js\r\n  //example.js\r\n  foo();\r\n   */\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n2. Tabbing does not tab relative to the doc comment block, but the overall document. This means that tab depth is off by one when writing examples in doc blocks, which results in really wonky indentation:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  /**\r\n   * this is an example function, here's how you use it\r\n   * \r\n   * ```js\r\n   * //example.js\r\n   * foo({\r\n   *  bar: 'baz'\r\n   * });\r\n   */\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nOne solution here is to allow a way to customize block comments. We are currently using comments _without_ a preceding asterisk:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n  this is an example function, here's how you use it\r\n  \r\n  ```js\r\n  //example.js\r\n  foo();\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is good for the most part, but VSCode doesn't expect it and actively fights it to some extent. It'll insert asterisks whenever we try to start a comment block, and if you copy paste some code after a block it'll mess up indentation (likely because it thinks that the closing `*/` represents the indentation level, but it's set back one space). The below example was a real world attempt to copy-paste the function and the comment:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    /**\r\n      Helper function to click with options like the meta key and ctrl key set\r\n\r\n      @param {Object} options - click event options\r\n    */\r\n   async clickWith(options) {\r\n    await click(findElement(this), options);\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to fix the comment blocks so the editor can handle them, allowing users to type markdown in line at proper indentation levels, and copy paste with preceding asterisks added. I think both options would be great wins for DX, especially since markdown helps with code examples in comments so much."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50291","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50291/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50291/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/50291/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/50291","id":325378167,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjUzNzgxNjc=","number":50291,"title":"Intellisense
