Open keyboard shortcuts settings\r\n2. Search for \"focus terminal\"\r\n\r\n**Expected:** The command called \"Terminal: Focus Terminal\" should be at/near the top of the list, since the command name contains an exact match for what I typed (and closely-related commands like \"Terminal: Focus _____\" should be soon after).\r\n\r\n**Actual:** It's waaayyyyy down at the bottom. Seems like an issue with the search ranking engine.\r\n\r\nEven if I search specifically for \"terminal: focus terminal\" the command which is an exact match is listed last.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Expand for screenshots of \"focus terminal\" search</summary>\r\n<img

version 1.31, horizontal scroll is now enabled for more trees and lists, including the source control view.  While this is nice, the buttons are all the way at the end, which is not ideal when there are long filenames or deeply nested files which go out of the view and require scrolling.  \r\nWould it be possible to have the on-hover buttons for the actions (discard changes, stage changes, etc) to be fixed to the current view similar to the explorer buttons?  It is harder to use the source control as is.\r\n\r\n\r\nButtons are out of the view\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13279967/52427985-ab756700-2ac6-11e9-983f-8bea4f9081fc.png)\r\n\r\nWhen buttons are in view, the filename is out of view.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13279967/52428097-e8d9f480-2ac6-11e9-9394-a03c1908a568.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFixed buttons independent of scroll:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13279967/52427301-56852100-2ac5-11e9-87a8-5829184c284f.png)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68123","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68123/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68123/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/68123/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68123","id":407772405,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDc3NzI0MDU=","number":68123,"title":"Specify terminal group for integrated terminal in launch configuration","user":{"login":"markfinlabs","id":26673915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjczOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/26673915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs","html_url":"https://github.com/markfinlabs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markfinlabs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTEwNTQ5MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":578047123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NzgwNDcxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"dcdcdc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2019-02-07T16:00:51Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T21:39:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"It is great to see that task configurations now allow the specification of terminal group (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/47265) - works well from my initial testing.
